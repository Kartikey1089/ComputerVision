1. color_det: In this we are detecting objects of different colours by inputing the colour ranges.
2. detect_object: In this we are detecting any object (in my case a red box) by inputting it's colour. Once detected it will give you the centre of the object with respect to the frame.
3. move_servo: Once we have detected our object and have it's position we can use that as an input to move a servo with respect to our object.
